# GmodWaterMod
This is an attempt at remaking 'Watermod'  , My goal is to add an system that makes flooding , Pressure , Pumps and oxygen a thing.
And yes, i know there is the EcoMod / WaterWorks, and for now this project is highly unstable and can be abandoned any second, cause if the Ecomod/WaterWorks mod does the trick, im not needed anymore.

This is a small list of things i think of doing, and possibly how i can do them.

- A tool ( Possibly named Hull tool ) to define certain Objects and enclosures as a single room.
I will try to do this using an system like the Cordon Tool , but idk how it works, or even how the basecode works.
I prob. will add a 'single prop' thingy for the 'doors'

- A tool ( Possibly named Gap tool ) to define places where rooms should be capable to send water to eachother ( To not create a random wall of water ) 
I will try to make this placeable at the walls of a Hull, this should make 2 hulls , or the outside of the map with the single hull.
Aswell will i try to make this work with a form of door system, but i for now have no idea.

- A command to make the map act like an Sea / Ocean , Making anything without a hull flood , and make the hull+Gap system work.
Honestly , for now idfk how to do this

- Pumps!  A machine , spawned by tool for now, that can pump out water inside the hull. I will try to make this work with wire.

- Oxygen? This will be a far shot , so i will work on the other things first.
If i were to do this, i will add an HUD effect to show the oxygen level, or, possibly, give it an layer that makes the screen fade to dark and back. With a swep to show the oxygen level , it will hopefully look like an radar out of Alien Isolation.

- Pressure? This will be the last thing ill try to add for now. It will be set with a console command, this will kill you slowly if you
are not inside a hull or wearing an specialized suit

And yes, i've noticed this looks alot like i would just port everything of barotrauma to gmod. And thats kinda what im going to do.
